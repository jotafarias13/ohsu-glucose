# OHSU Glucose

This project contains the code and data used in Jo√£o Farias' Doctoral Thesis. To reproduce the results, in the order they are presented in the document, follow the steps below.

# Setup

First of all, clone this repository to your local machine.

``` shell
git clone git@github.com:jotafarias13/ohsu-glucose.git      # if using ssh or
git clone https://github.com/jotafarias13/ohsu-glucose.git  # if using https
```

The project is coded in python. The recommended way to execute the script is using `uv`, a complete package manager for python. If using `uv`, run the following to install the project.

``` shell
uv sync
```

If you prefer not to use `uv`, you must create a virtual environment in the directory, activate it, and install dependencies like so.

``` shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
